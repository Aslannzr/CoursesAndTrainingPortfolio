Tools for Reactive Flow Modeling
======================

Cantera
----------
Oliver uses cantera, CVODE for kinetics, 0D and 1D CFD. Python interface. Less extended for matlab implementation. Using it for simple computation of flame speed. Not coupled to openFOAM. In OF 1.5 cantera was coupled to OF. Not further developed due to changes in the thermodynamic interface.

[Detchem](http://www.detchem.com/)
-------
Detchem developed by KIT. Commercial for the catalytic combustion. Additional library, but not a solver. Similar to cantera.
